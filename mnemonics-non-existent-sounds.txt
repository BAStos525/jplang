Vowels are not good to use at mnemonic's end.
Letters that can be a mnemonic are bad, i.e. using "kits" for KI, because it sounds like its for KITSU.

The sounds below can appear as second/third letters in ON yomi:
チ or chi appears 14 times
ク or ku appears 51 times
キ or ki appears 13 times
ウ or u appears 39 times
ツ or tsu appears 41 times
ン or n appears 63 times
イ or i appears 31 times
Therefore these sounds should be avoided when they fall on the end of mnemonic.


CMU dict sounds that should be used at mnemonic's end i.e. to mark that mnemonic part is finished:
B, D, DH, F, HH, L, M, OW, OY, P, R, S, SH, TH, V, W, Z, ZH 

Sounds that should NOT be used:
AA, AE, AH, AO, AW, AY, CH, EH, ER, EY, G, IH, IY, JH, K, N, NG, T, UH, UW, Y ,


The sound written as OW *always* means "ou" japanese sound.

Some english words that start with "wrong" letter for the on yomi, can still be used:
c -> K
l -> R
p ->
q ->
v -> 
w -> 
x -> Z

There is no HIK*, therefore JIK* can use words that start with H.

There is no SAN, so can use SAN for SHAN
To get KU sound must be K + consonant
Intermix K and HH
To start H words they can start with W  (whack)
