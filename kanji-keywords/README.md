Why is "Test Content Specifications" no longer available after the 2010 revision of the JLPT?

We believe that the ultimate goal of studying Japanese is to use the language to communicate rather than simply memorizing vocabulary, kanji and grammar items. Based on this idea, the JLPT measures "language knowledge such as characters, vocabulary and grammar" as well as "competence to perform communicative tasks by using the language knowledge." Therefore, we decided that publishing "Test Content Specifications" containing a list of vocabulary, kanji and grammar items was not necessarily appropriate.

news.json and twitter.json from scriptin github: https://github.com/scriptin/kanji-frequency
Its nowadays best not to use Aozora Bunpou because its old and kanji and words are old. That stuff is not even UTF-8.

Some kanji from twitter are not worth learning, i.e. obscure kanji used just for emoji not for its meaning:
- explanation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiong
- unicode code point 56e7 http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=56e7
